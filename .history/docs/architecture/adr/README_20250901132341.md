# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant architectural decisions made during the design and implementation of the Core Life Cycle Management Service.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made during a project. They provide context for why certain decisions were made and help future developers understand the reasoning behind the current architecture.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title**: A descriptive title for the decision
2. **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
3. **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
4. **Decision**: The decision that was made
5. **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision
6. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
7. **Implementation Notes**: Technical details for implementation

## ADR List

### [ADR-001: Service Architecture Pattern](001-service-architecture-pattern.md)
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Decision**: Single Lifecycle Management Service with internal component separation
- **Rationale**: Balance between simplicity and complexity management

### [ADR-002: CDM-Inspired Event Model](002-cdm-inspired-event-model.md)
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Decision**: CDM-inspired architecture with custom extensions for synthetic swaps
- **Rationale**: Industry standards with business-specific flexibility

### [ADR-003: Data Persistence Strategy](003-data-persistence-strategy.md)
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Decision**: Polyglot persistence with MS SQL Server, Redis, and Kafka
- **Rationale**: Right tool for right job based on data characteristics

### [ADR-003: Cash Flow Architecture](003-cash-flow-architecture.md)
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Decision**: Multi-stage cash flow processing with specialized components
- **Rationale**: Complex cash flow requirements with dual types and multi-stage processing

### [ADR-004: Event Streaming Architecture](004-event-streaming-architecture.md)
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Decision**: Apache Kafka for event streaming with guaranteed ordering
- **Rationale**: High throughput and ordering guarantees for regulatory compliance

### [ADR-005: Container Deployment Strategy](005-container-deployment-strategy.md)
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Decision**: Kubernetes-based container orchestration with auto-scaling
- **Rationale**: Scalability and operational efficiency

## Adding New ADRs

When creating a new ADR:

1. Use the next sequential number
2. Follow the standard ADR format
3. Update this README with the new ADR
4. Ensure the decision is well-documented and justified

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Initial proposal for review
2. **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and implemented
3. **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer relevant
4. **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Review Process

ADRs should be reviewed by:
- Architecture team
- Development team leads
- Product owners
- Security and compliance teams

# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This section contains the high-level architecture documentation for the Core Life Cycle Management Service. The architecture is designed to handle complex synthetic equity swaps with high performance, regulatory compliance, and scalability requirements.

## Architecture Principles

1. **CDM-Inspired**: Based on FINOS CDM Event Model with custom extensions
2. **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous processing with event sourcing
3. **High Performance**: Optimized for 1M+ daily position updates
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: MiFID, Dodd-Frank, and other frameworks
5. **Scalability**: Container-based deployment with auto-scaling
6. **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, and fallbacks

## Key Design Decisions

- **Single Lifecycle Management Service**: Unified service for contract and position management
- **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail and state reconstruction capability
- **Real-time Processing**: Event-driven architecture for immediate response
- **Polyglot Persistence**: Right tool for right job (MS SQL + Redis + Kafka)
- **Container-Based Deployment**: Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling

## Performance Requirements

- **Position Updates**: 1M daily with <100ms response time
- **Peak Load**: 4x capacity during 4 PM peak
- **Regulatory SLA**: <15 minutes end-to-end
- **Corporate Actions**: Concurrent processing (vs. current serial)
- **Real-time Aggregations**: <10ms for position slicing and dicing

## Regulatory Compliance

- **MiFID II**: Transaction reporting, best execution
- **Dodd-Frank**: Swap data reporting, clearing requirements
- **Basel III**: Risk-weighted asset calculations
- **SOX**: Financial reporting controls
- **Event Ordering**: Guaranteed ordering for regulatory reporting

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Java 21, Spring Boot
- **Database**: MS SQL Server (ACID), Redis (caching), Kafka (events)
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka (event streaming), Solace (reliable)
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger
- **Testing**: JUnit, TestContainers, JMeter

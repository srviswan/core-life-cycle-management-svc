# Documentation Update Summary

## Updated Files

### 1. ALLOCATOR_OPTIMIZATIONS.md
**Changes:**
- Updated title from "Enhancement Opportunities" to "Complete Implementation"
- Changed all optimizations from "Potential" to "✅ IMPLEMENTED"
- Updated status descriptions to reflect current implementation
- Removed "Recommended Priority Order" (all are implemented)
- Added usage examples
- Updated file references to current structure

**Key Updates:**
- All 15 optimizations marked as implemented
- Added usage instructions for each feature
- Removed references to old implementations
- Added current file structure

### 2. OPTIMIZATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md
**Changes:**
- Updated comparison table (removed Basic/Enhanced columns)
- Updated demo instructions
- Removed references to old allocators
- Updated to reflect single allocator implementation

## Current Documentation Structure

1. **ALLOCATOR_OPTIMIZATIONS.md** - Complete list of all optimizations with implementation status
2. **OPTIMIZATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Detailed implementation guide and usage
3. **README_OPTIMIZATIONS.md** - Quick start guide
4. **REMAINING_CAPACITY_FEATURE.md** - Feature documentation for remaining capacity
5. **CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of codebase cleanup

## Documentation Status

✅ All documentation updated to reflect:
- Single allocator implementation (`allocate_fully_optimized.py`)
- All 15 optimizations implemented
- Current file structure
- Current usage patterns
- No references to old implementations

## Key Points

1. **All optimizations are implemented** - Not "potential" anymore
2. **Single source of truth** - One allocator file
3. **Fully configurable** - All features can be enabled/disabled
4. **Production ready** - All features tested and working

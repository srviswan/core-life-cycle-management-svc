# Objective Function Weights
# All weights set to 0.0 to prioritize budget maximization over other objectives
# This allows full employee allocation without penalty terms interfering
weights:
  cost_weight: 0.0  # Disabled - budget maximization handles this
  skill_weight: 0.0  # Disabled - allow allocations without perfect skill matches
  fragmentation_weight: 0.0  # Disabled
  continuity_weight: 0.0  # Disabled
  balance_weight: 0.0  # Disabled - allow full allocation to employees
  preference_weight: 0.0  # Disabled
  diversity_weight: 0.0  # Disabled
  leveling_weight: 0.0  # Disabled
  role_balance_weight: 0.0  # Disabled since enforce_role_allocation is False
